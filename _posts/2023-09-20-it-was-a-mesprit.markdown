I saw a pink, small, litle fella in the lake. I sawer it's not any of the other lifeforms in the area. JK, it's just my Mesprit.

I'll tell ya, for a lake grundian, it's firednly.

It's slowly getting used to me and my other pokemon.  And, I've discovered that it likes getting pet on the head, and tails. It has let me pet it's gemstone.

Yes, I'm aware that the myth says that "if you touch it you lose all emotions". It's never happened to me. If it did, it would put them back.

Plus, if it takes, it can give back. So, that shouldn't be a problem.

My Mesprit is a surprise, I never had expected it to be so sweet.
