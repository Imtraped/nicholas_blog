I saw a pink, small, litle fella in the lake. I sawer it's not any of the other lifeforms in the area.

    > Are you sure it wasn't?

"It could've been a Mesprit."

That pokemon is not real, stop subscribing to that conspiracy theory magazine of yours.

"Bro, Mach, and I have seen it."

~~Yeah, the pokemon often plays with the water and other pelope around the lake.~~

    > Even I, The only vampire in the research team have seen it. I walk around the lake every night with it.

~~Hey Nick, show Quan the pokedex entry you got from scanning it.~~

    >Ok, Hang on.

*Mesprit, The Emotion Pokemon. Number: 481. Danger Level: 2/9. Sometimes, it's seen playing on the lake's surface, it may let other pokemon or more rarely people, join in. Firendly, but mischievous. You can touch it, that's just a myth. But, the taking of emotions part is real. Adivce: Don't mess with it.*

How do you have it's entry?

    >I've caught one :)

WHAT?

~~Sorry, Bard. Nick works in mysterious ways. All of us we're surpersied, he won't tell us how.~~

    >She's not comfortable with y'all yet.

SHE???????!!!??? You know what, I'm done here, GOODBYE, YOU FAKER.
